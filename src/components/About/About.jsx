I have been working as a 3D artist and designer for almost 2 years. –êt the moment I live and work in Russia, more specifically, in Ekaterinburg where I completed my education as an architect and designer. I`d love to take on every project. My main preference is working with interior details. I like to combine different compositions and colors, structures and lines. On this site I present some works which I have done from the beginning until today.",
